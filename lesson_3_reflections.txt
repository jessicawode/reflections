When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

If you want to share your work with others who are not on your local network, or
you want to get suggested changes from others, then using a remote repository is
a great idea.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are collaborating with others, they might make changes to your files on
GitHub that you don't want on your local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Use a fork when a repository exists on someone else's GitHub account and you
want to make changes but are not a collaborator on their repository. Use cloning
when you want to copy something from your GitHub account to your local computer
or from another location on your network. Use branching when you want to create
some new part of your existing project without affecting the primary version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can work offline using the latest version of the repository.
