When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to share your work with others who are not on your local network, or you want to get suggested changes from others, then
using a remote repository is a great idea.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are collaborating with others, they might make changes to your files on GitHub that you don't want on your local machine.
